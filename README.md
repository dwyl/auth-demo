# _Why_? ðŸ¤·



# _What_? ðŸ’­

This project is intended as a _barebones_ demonstration
of using
[`elixir-auth-google`](https://github.com/dwyl/elixir-auth-google)
to add support for "***Sign-in with Google***" to your Phoenix Application.

# _Who_? ðŸ‘¥

This demos is intended for people of all Elixir/Phoenix skill levels.
Anyone who wants the "***Sign-in with Google***" functionality
without the extra steps to configure a whole auth _framework_.


# _How?_ ðŸ’»


1. Create a New Phoenix App

Create a new project if you don't already have one:

```
mix phx.new app
```

If prompted to install dependencies `Fetch and install dependencies? [Yn]`
Type `y` and hit the `[Enter]` key to install.

You should see something like this:
```
* running mix deps.get
* running cd assets && npm install && node node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js
* running mix deps.compile
```

Make sure that everything works before proceeding:
```
mix test
```
You should see:
```
Generated app app
...

Finished in 0.02 seconds
3 tests, 0 failures
```
The default tests pass and you know phoenix is compiling.

Run the web application:

```
mix phx.server
```

and visit the endpoint in your web browser: http://localhost:4000/

2.

--no-context


To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`
