# auth-demo

A basic example of using Google Auth in a Phoenix App.


# What?

This project is intended as a _barebones_ demonstration
of using
[`elixir-auth-google`](https://github.com/dwyl/elixir-auth-google)
to add support for "Sign-in with Google" to your Phoenix Application.


# How?


Create a new project if you don't already have one:
```
mix phx.new app
```





--no-context


To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`
